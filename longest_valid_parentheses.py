def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

    This function uses a stack to keep track of the indices of open parentheses.
    When a closing parenthesis is encountered, we can determine the length of the
    valid substring ending at that point.

    Args:
        s: The input string containing only '(' and ')' characters.

    Returns:
        The length of the longest valid parentheses substring.
